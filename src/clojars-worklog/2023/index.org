The work this month was modernization: we moved away from [[https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql][yesql]] in favor of
[[https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql][honeysql]], and to [[https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc][next.jdbc]] from [[https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc][clojure.java.jdbc]]:

+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/2d09602722df78ef40e30f5d9bcf01df011af27e][Convert from yesql to honeysql for SQL queries]]

Most of September was vacation, but I did make a few improvements towards the
end of the month:

+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/29b5d25cdc8ede87a35967691110f84a4a8c23d1][Prevent memory leak from in-memory session store]] This was the source of intermittent OOMs for years, and I finally tracked it down.
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/pull/874][Require a license in the POM for new projects]]

I took this month to clean up some long-standing issues:

+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/issues/659][Fixed an issue with error reporting from the repository routes]]
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/issues/563][Include release date for each version in feed.clj]]
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/issues/564][Include scm tag for each version in feed.clj]]
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/issues/823][Require MFA group wide to deploy]]

And a few quality of life improvements:

+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/0d33a469744f71aa965eac40c6a9cdebd44edefa][Add denylist to email sender]]
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/pull/872][Migrate from project.clj to deps.edn]]
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/0a5eb2175e7b417fc9e64bcb6fb87f6d15cbddbc][Upgraded to latest clj-kondo for code linting]]

The [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/blob/main/CHANGELOG.org][CHANGELOG file]] also covers any user-facing changes.
