This month I released the [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/pull/877][permissions system rewrite]], updated the release logic
to [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/pull/875][require a license in the POM for all releases]], and made a few other minor improvements:
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/8d5b8e2c4b93771a34ecb1b14e5d5cbf62d2491e][Use long polling with SQS]]
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/b60afa3cf8c181fe511b71a1ade27bd04c46110f][Throw on SQS receive-loop exception to force prcess to exit]]
+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/785266dbcbc0ea3fea4ccf55a8992f2ed62183f4][Use mock mailer in development]]

On the infrastructure front, I added [[https://github.com/clojars/infrastructure/compare/30bab1d3eefea9963117496c9aa420680ee3efc2...57142fd9726c1f6ba42abedfe696632893c58621][disk space and SQS queue delay alarms]] so we
can be better informed of when things go wrong.

I [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/pull/877][rewrote the permissions system]] this month to support [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/issues/709][project-level scoping]],
allowing delegation of deploy rights to a user for a subset of projects under a
group. This was released in December.

I also made [[https://github.com/clojars/infrastructure/commit/30bab1d3eefea9963117496c9aa420680ee3efc2][improvements to the AMI release process]].

The work this month was modernization: we moved away from [[https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql][yesql]] in favor of
[[https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql][honeysql]], and to [[https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc][next.jdbc]] from [[https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc][clojure.java.jdbc]]:

+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/2d09602722df78ef40e30f5d9bcf01df011af27e][Convert from yesql to honeysql for SQL queries]]

Most of September was vacation, but I did make a few improvements towards the
end of the month:

+ [[https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/commit/29b5d25cdc8ede87a35967691110f84a4a8c23d1][Prevent memory leak from in-memory session store]] This was the source of intermittent OOMs for years, and I finally tracked it down.
